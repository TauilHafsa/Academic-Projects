Sorting Algorithms are a set of steps that allows arranging a dataset in ascending or descending order. Their purpose is to make the data easier to use and manipulate by sorting them according to specific criteria. These sorting algorithms can also help improve application performance by reducing search times and facilitating data processing operations.
Here you will find the implementation in c of these algorithms:

- Selection sort

- Insertion sort

- Bubble sort

- Quick sort

- Merge sort
